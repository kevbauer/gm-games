This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay.

Entries in bold are ones important enough that I would have put them in [the old changelog](./CHANGELOG-old.md).

* 2020-08-30: Frivolity to show which jersey numbers had the most/best players, and the top players who wore each jersey number.

* 2020-08-26: Tweaks to game simulation in the playoffs, most notably resulting in fewer upsets. Also injuries in the playoffs are shorter, to work around the fact that currently there is no way to have players play through minor injuries. [[1]](https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games/pull/293)

* 2020-08-18: If you are successful (high score in the owner's annual performance review) then sometimes other teams will try to hire you. This happens between the playoffs and draft. Previously, the only way to change teams was to get fired or use God Mode. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/iccozz/if_you_are_successful_high_score_in_the_owners/)

* 2020-08-18: Purely cosmetic player attributes that don't affect gameplay or achievements (name, height (inches), weight (lbs), jersey number, college) are editable outside of God Mode by going to a player's page and clicking Edit Player. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/iccp0h/purely_cosmetic_player_attributes_that_dont/)

* 2020-08-17: Added TS%, 3PAr, and FTr to the player info popup. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ibqgvt/there_have_been_some_requests_for_fg3pft_on_the/)

* 2020-08-17: If you do enough to win an achievement but miss out on it because you used God Mode or easy difficulty, it gives you a notification saying this rather than nothing. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ib84ki/a_minor_improvement_from_me_and_more_important/?)

* 2020-08-17: Added "Finals Appearances" and total winning percentage to the Team History page. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ib84ki/a_minor_improvement_from_me_and_more_important/?)

* 2020-08-13: You can watch multiple live games in a single day! Now when you watch a live game, only that one game is simulated. When it's over, the other games from that day will still be waiting to be played. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i9a6gm/new_in_version_202008131365_you_can_watch/)

* 2020-08-12: New frivolities: Best Teams, Worst Teams, Best Non-Playoff Teams, Worst Playoff Teams, Worst Finals Teams, and Worst Championship Teams.

* 2020-08-10: The contract generation algorithm has been rewritten. It should be both more realistic and harder to take advantage of. Most noticeably, you should no longer see players ask for too much money and go unsigned. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i5qoj3/new_beta_feature_smarter_contracts_no_more_good/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i77k9w/smarter_contract_generation_is_live_in_version/)

* 2020-08-10: In BBGM, box scores show players who didn't play as DNP (either "Injury" or "Coach's decision") rather than showing a row of all 0s.

* 2020-08-08: Copying the trend in most other basketball sites, the default standings in BBGM are now conference standings, not division standings. FBGM is not changed.

* 2020-08-08: Team records are shown below logos in box scores. And yeah, when you're watching a live game, the records update when the game finishes :) [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i6792d/in_the_live_game_playbyplay_fouls_show_how_many/)

* 2020-08-08: In BBGM, in the live game play-by-play, fouls show how many free throws will be upcoming. Like "Shooting foul on Dane Wishnowsky, two FTs for Stephen Lees". Additionally, shot attempts appear on their own line before saying if they are made or missed. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i6792d/in_the_live_game_playbyplay_fouls_show_how_many/)

* 2020-08-02: Added a "Delete Player" button to player profile pages.

* 2020-07-27: On the trade page, the trade summary and controls are "sticky" as you scroll so they're always on the screen. This is especially important for FBGM where rosters are huge and much scrolling is required. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hz68ru/this_is_more_important_for_fbgm_than_bbgm_but_on/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hz69o2/on_the_trade_page_the_trade_summary_and_controls/)

* 2020-07-27: Better support for customization of player names, countries, and colleges. And improvements to the built-in names database. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/07/better-customization-player-names-countries-colleges/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hyz51u/new_in_version_202007271168_better_support_for/)

[[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/07/game-sim-realism/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hwr0eu/three_improvements_to_game_simulation_realism/)

* 2020-07-16: In FBGM, added the Roster Composition table to the re-signing players screen.

* 2020-07-11: God Mode option to enable/disable ties. So for BBGM ties are now possible, and for FBGM you can turn off ties. Ties only can happen in regular season games, and occur after one overtime period. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hpn011/god_mode_option_to_enable_ties_version/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hpmzz9/god_mode_option_to_disable_ties_version/)

* 2020-07-10: For FBGM, improved AV formula for OL and defensive players, resulting in higher AV for top players at those positions. I also updated the MVP and DPOY formulas to account for this, hopefully retaining good position balance.

* 2020-07-09: A bunch of small FBGM improvements. [[1]](https://football-gm.com/blog/2020/07/recent-development-av-kickers-punters-future/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hogban/recent_development_some_small_improvements/)

* 2020-07-08: Tools > Auto Play now lets you specify a phase (playoffs, draft, etc) to sim to, rather than only allowing auto sim to the preseason. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hnsxf0/tools_auto_play_now_lets_you_specify_a_phase/)

* 2020-07-07: On the Playoffs page, the series score links to the most recent box score from that series.

* 2020-07-06: The Customize Player form includes the ability to change a player's Hall of Fame induction status. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hmiq0p/another_minor_new_feature_that_has_been_requested/)

* 2020-06-29: Logos for all the new teams! [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/logos-for-the-new-teams/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hid1tg/logos_for_all_the_new_teams/)

* 2020-06-27: Random debuts mode now works how you probably wanted it to work in the first place. The pool of players to be randomized is not just current and future players (relative to your starting season), but past players too. So if you start in 2020, you'll get many future draft classes of randomized real players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hh71an/random_debuts_mode_now_works_how_you_probably/?)

* 2020-06-27: Menu on the Standings page to switch between League/Conference/Division standings, which is important on mobile where previously only the division standings were visible. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgxh7p/menu_on_the_standings_page_to_switch_between/)

* 2020-06-26: Added "Fast Forward" button to live game sim, allowing you to jump ahead by some number of minutes or until the end of the quarter. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hglnsz/another_minor_usability_improvement_a_fast/)

* 2020-06-26: +/- buttons for adjusting multiple ratings on the Customize Player page. For BBGM it's all ratings except height. For FBGM it's position-specific and athleticism ratings.

* 2020-06-26: Logos are shown in box scores if the window is big enough.

* 2020-06-26: Support for exporting/importing individual players or groups of players, at Tools > Import/Export Players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgakyd/import_and_export_individual_players_from_leagues/)

* 2020-06-19: Added an "Export draft class" button to the Draft History page so you can export and re-use historical draft classes.

* 2020-06-18: Awards, All-Star selections, and league leaders are now determined based on total season stats for traded players, rather than just stats from their latest team. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hbqod0/awards_allstar_selections_and_league_leaders_are/)

* 2020-06-16: You can customize the order and visibility of columns in most tables by pressing the "..." button to the top right of the table and clicking "Customize Columns". [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hahhm5/customizable_columns_on_most_tables_in_version/)

* 2020-06-15: More intelligent end-of-game substitution patterns in BBGM, both for blowouts and close games.

* **2020-06-13: A bunch of new options for league creation: challenge modes (no draft picks, no free agents, no trades, no visible ratings), player development realism, and more. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/league-creation-options/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/h8dq90/a_bunch_of_new_options_for_league_creation/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/h8dr1y/a_bunch_of_new_options_for_league_creation/)**

* 2020-06-08: Standings now show when teams clinch the playoffs, a first round bye, or the #1 overall seed. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gzd6qm/standings_now_show_when_teams_clinch_the_playoffs/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/gzd8q6/standings_now_show_when_teams_clinch_the_playoffs/)

* 2020-06-08: Sortable table rows (roster, fantasy draft, football depth chart) can be reordered by clicking two rows to swap them, in addition to dragging like normal. This is sometimes easier on mobile.

* **2020-06-07: Added the News Feed page, available in the League menu. This incorporates a score for each event that happens, allowing you to filter events by importance. This replaces the old Transactions and Event Log pages. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/news-feed/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gyc615/news_feed_changes_are_live_in_version_202006070785/)**

* 2020-06-03: If you use God Mode to retire a player, it checks for Hall of Fame eligibility and notifies you if he makes it. And when you edit a player's contract, it also updates the "Salaries" table on player pages and the "Career Earnings" frivolity. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gvtw5o/new_features_in_version_202006030801_real_rosters/)

* 2020-06-03: Revamped Team Records page, including team relocations, renames, and contraction. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gvtw5o/new_features_in_version_202006030801_real_rosters/)

* **2020-06-03: Support for disabling teams in Tools > Manage Teams. History of disabled teams is preserved and they can come back at a future date, either by re-enabling on Manage Teams or going to Tools > Expansion Draft, where you will see disabled teams as possible expansion teams. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gvtw5o/new_features_in_version_202006030801_real_rosters/)**

* 2020-05-26: Added a ton of new frivolities and redesigned the frivolities page. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/05/new-frivolities/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gr57hl/i_just_added_12_new_frivolities_available_within/)

* 2020-05-24: New option "random debuts" when creating a real players league, which randomizes every player's draft year so different players will appear at different times. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gq13b4/new_option_random_debuts_when_creating_a_real/)

* 2020-05-22: Button on the Create/Edit Player page to randomize player ratings, which works by generating a random player of the same age and copying his ratings over. In FBGM it also matches by position.

* 2020-05-21: When using historical rosters with pre-scheduled expansion drafts, you now are given the option of taking control of expansion teams. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/goaypl/when_using_historical_rosters_with_prescheduled/)

* 2020-05-20: New hair styles! [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gnowab/thanks_to_usmileyoaks_there_are_some_new_hair/)

* 2020-05-20: AI teams draft smarter. Previously the probability they would pick a player depended only on that player's rank, but now it depends on how good the players are. So the AI will almost always take the clear #1 pick, but there will be more randomness if the top available prospects have similar talents.

* 2020-05-19: You can now create a "legends" league filled with the best players in each franchise's history. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/05/legends-leagues/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gmznsx/new_in_version_202005191391_you_can_now_create_a/)

* 2020-05-14: Shows the team a player was selected from in the "Drafted" table of expansion drafts.

* 2020-05-14: Historical rosters in BBGM include team abbreviations that change when a team moves, without breaking links to team pages from past seasons. Some parts of the UI still incorrectly display the current abbreviation rather than the historical one.

* 2020-05-14: "Team History" page shows team region and name from past seasons. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gjy01l/version_202005141399_team_history_page_shows_team/)

* 2020-05-13: "Sim to game" button on the schedule page, which now also includes the All-Star game.

* 2020-05-11: Revamped the UI for selecting a live game to watch. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gi1gpu/i_also_snuck_this_update_into_todays_release_the/)

* 2020-05-10: Schedules for leagues with non-standard teams and divisions now have balanced home/away games when possible. Or at least close to that - it's not a deterministic algorithm, but it works pretty well.

* 2020-05-10: New League Stats page which lets you see team stats for all seasons in one table.

* **2020-05-09: Added real historical rosters back to 1956 in BBGM. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/05/beta-real-rosters-back-to-1956/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gghq04/real_rosters_back_to_1956_is_officially_in_beta/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ghw91z/official_release_real_rosters_back_to_1956/)**

* 2020-05-03: Added support for team info changes (name, region, logo, etc.) to be predefined in a league file and trigger only at a certain year.

* **2020-05-03: In BBGM, added game simulation settings to God Mode to allow for more realistic simulation of different eras of basketball, when things like pace and 3 point shooting were very different.**

* 2020-05-02: Added the ability to change what division/conference a team belongs to from Tools > Manage Teams.

* 2020-05-02: Added tracking of changes to team info (name, region, logo, etc.) so they can be displayed correctly when viewing historical data. Previously, updating a team's name (for example) would update it when viewing data from past seasons too.

* 2020-05-01: Added a way to temporarily disable auto save to the Danger Zone screen.
